# Visual Builder corrections: timer merge, POV box, property prefill

**Date:** 2026-06-14
**Status:** Approved — ready for implementation
**Area:** OBS collection (`src/obs/GT_Endurance.json`, `src/obs/hud.html`,
removes `src/obs/timer.html`), relay (`src/relay/racecast-feeds.py`), overlay
compiler (`src/scripts/overlay_build.py`), Control Center builder
(`src/ui/control-center.html`, `src/ui/ui_server.py`).
**Supersedes parts of:** `2026-06-13-visual-overlay-builder-design.md` (the
two-page HUD/Timer model — this folds the timer into the HUD).

## Problem

Three operator-reported issues with the visual overlay builder (#114, #146):

1. **The timer is isolated from the HUD.** It lives on its own builder tab, its
   own page (`timer.html`), its own CSS (`timer.css`) and its own OBS browser
   source (`HUD Race Timer`). You cannot see or adjust it in the context of the
   HUD it sits over.
2. **The timer renders at the wrong size/position in the builder.** `timer.html`
   draws a 420px clock at `top:217` on a raw 1920×1080 canvas. OBS then crops it
   to `y[217..895]`, scales it `0.0854`, and places it at `(880, 98)`. The
   builder shows the un-cropped, un-scaled page, so the Timer tab is a giant
   clock over the lower-third frame — nothing like air. Maximally confusing.
3. **Property fields show only overrides, never the template defaults.** A slot
   with no override shows empty fields, so the operator has no idea where a slot
   currently is or how big it is.
4. **The POV box has no fill/border controls** (`data-edit-props="left,top,width,height"`).
5. **The POV box default position was guessed** (`left:40 top:560 480×270`),
   unrelated to where the real POV picture-in-picture sits.

## Decisions (confirmed with the producer)

- **Merge the timer into the main HUD** (one page, one CSS, one OBS source). The
  setup is not live yet, so the OBS scene-layout change is acceptable. Verified
  in the collection: the `HUD Race Timer` source has an *identical* transform in
  every scene that shows it (`Stint`, `Splitscreen`) and is *always* shown
  together with `HUD Overlay` — it is never placed or toggled independently.
  Timer show/hide stays director-driven via the `/timer/*` control endpoints
  (the clock self-blanks on `state.visible`), so no OBS-source-level toggle is
  lost in practice.
- **POV background + border render live** (a framed PiP on the broadcast HUD),
  not a builder-only guide.
- **Prefill + save-all**: fields are pre-filled from the template's effective
  values, and Save writes the full property snapshot per slot (not only the
  diff). The producer accepts that this freezes a profile's look against future
  base-CSS changes.

## Key insight: one page = one canvas = exactly what is on air

The confusion (issues 1+2) is a direct consequence of the timer being a separate
OBS source cropped+scaled+repositioned from a 1920×1080 page. Folding the clock
into `hud.html` as one more absolutely-positioned slot at its **true on-air
geometry** removes the transform entirely: the builder canvas becomes a literal
1:1 preview of the broadcast, and the timer is edited in place at real scale. No
second coordinate system, no transform math, no `420px→0.0854` hack.

## Architecture changes

### OBS collection (`src/obs/GT_Endurance.json`)

- **Remove** the `HUD Race Timer` browser source (source def + its scene items
  in `Stint` and `Splitscreen`). The clock is now part of the `/hud` page served
  by the `HUD Overlay` source.
- **Reorder** so `HUD Overlay` composites **above** `Feed POV` in every scene
  that contains both. Required so the POV frame drawn by the HUD page (below)
  renders over the video edges instead of being hidden behind the POV media
  source. The `#pov` box keeps a transparent center, so the video still shows
  through; only the border/background frame it.
- Re-tokenize with `tools/tokenize-obs.py` if image basenames/URLs shifted; the
  build verify step must still pass (no secrets, tokens intact).

### HUD page (`src/obs/hud.html`)

- **Add a `#clock` slot** at its true on-air geometry. Derivation from the old
  OBS transform (crop `y[217..895]` = 678px page window, scale `0.0854`, pos
  `(880, 98)`): the clock lands at roughly `left:889px top:98px`, `font-size`
  ≈ `36px`, keeping the monospace stack, `font-weight:700`,
  `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`, and the existing text-shadow. **Exact
  pixels are verified live** against the pre-merge on-air look (the producer's
  app is running) — the numbers above are the starting estimate, not asserted
  fact.
- **Add a second poll loop** for the clock: `GET /timer/data` (2000ms poll +
  250ms local tick against the end anchor), kept as its own functions next to
  the existing `/hud/data` loop. The clock self-blanks when `!state.visible`.
- `#clock` carries `data-edit="Clock"` with the default text-slot prop set
  (`left,top,width,height,fontSize,fontFamily,color,background,align`).
- **POV box** (`#pov`):
  - Default position aligned to the OBS `Feed POV` box:
    `left:1496px; top:644px; width:384px; height:216px;`.
  - `data-edit-props` gains `background,borderStyle,borderColor,borderWidth`.
  - No fill/border by default → the box stays invisible on air unless styled
    (unchanged default behavior).

### Relay (`src/relay/racecast-feeds.py`)

- **Keep** all timer state/control endpoints unchanged: `/timer/data` and the
  director actions (`/timer/start`, `/timer/pause`, `/timer/reset`, …). The
  merged HUD page is now their only consumer page.
- **Remove** the timer *page* surface: the `/timer` route (served
  `timer.html`) and `/timer/override.css`.
- **`OBS_PAGE_PATHS`**: drop `/timer` and `/timer/override.css`; the refresh
  hash now covers `/hud`, `/hud/override.css` only (the timer is part of `/hud`).
- **Delete** `src/obs/timer.html`.

### Overlay compiler (`src/scripts/overlay_build.py`)

- **Single page.** Remove the `timer` page from `SAMPLE` (move `"clock":
  "1:23:45"` into the `hud` sample) and from all page branching. `extract_slots`
  now naturally returns `#clock` from `hud.html`.
- **New properties** in the prop→CSS map:
  - `borderStyle → border-style` (enum value: `none|solid|dashed|dotted`)
  - `borderColor → border-color`
  - `borderWidth → border-width` (px; add to `_PX_PROPS` and `PROP_ORDER`)
  - `background` already exists.
- The existing safety gates (`_safe_value`, `_UNSAFE_VALUE`, allowed-prop
  gating) apply to the new props unchanged.

### Builder UI (`src/ui/control-center.html`)

- **Remove the HUD/Timer tabs** and `setOverlayPage`/per-page branching;
  `overlayPage` is always `hud`. The single canvas now includes the clock and
  the POV box.
- **Property prefill (`ovRenderPanel`)**: when a slot is selected, fields show
  the slot's **effective value read from the rendered shadow-DOM element via
  `getComputedStyle`** (the cascade ground-truth from base `hud.html`):
  `left, top, width, height, fontSize, color, background, borderWidth` as real
  numbers; colors normalized to `#rrggbb`. `fontFamily`/`align` show the
  effective value as an "(inherited)" hint but remain override-on-change
  (prefilling the base font stack is noise). A small pure color-normalizer
  (`rgb()`→hex) is unit-tested.
- **POV panel**: add background color, border style (`none/solid/dashed/dotted`
  select), border color, and border width fields, gated by the slot's
  `data-edit-props`.
- **Save-all (`saveOverlay`)**: build the layout so every editable slot carries
  its full effective property set (computed base merged with user edits), then
  POST as today. The compiled `hud.css` fully pins each slot. The map in
  `OV_CSSNAME`/`OV_PX` gains the border props to mirror `overlay_build.py`.
- Drop the timer-page migration note and `layout-timer.json` handling.

### Control Center server (`src/ui/ui_server.py`)

- The overlay endpoints (`/api/overlay/slots|layout|fonts|bg|font`) collapse to
  the single `hud` page: ignore/deprecate the `page` query (always `hud`), stop
  reading/writing `layout-timer.json` / `timer.css`. `/api/overlay/bg` still
  serves the profile's `Overlay.png`.

## Data flow (unchanged where possible)

```
hud.html (base CSS + #clock + #pov + data-edit markers)
   │  builder canvas renders it 1:1 in a Shadow-DOM host over Overlay.png
   │  getComputedStyle → prefill the property panel
   ▼
layout-hud.json   (full per-slot snapshots; builder owns it)
   │  compile_overlay_css(layout, slots)
   ▼
profiles/<name>/overlay/hud.css   (served at /hud/override.css; hash gate → OBS refresh)
```

The relay's live data binding (`/hud/data`, `/timer/data`) is untouched.

## Migration & coexistence

- Existing profiles: any hand-written `timer.css` / `layout-timer.json` is now
  orphaned. On first builder load, if a legacy `timer.css` is non-empty, append
  it verbatim into the HUD layout's `customCss` once (same migration sink as the
  original spec) so no styling is silently lost; then ignore the timer files.
  The single existing profile (`iro-gtec`) likely has no timer customization.
- The `/hud` page absorbs the timer; OBS browser sources auto-refresh via the
  existing hash gate on the next `relay start` / `obs refresh`.

## Out of scope (unchanged)

- Editing the `Overlay.png` frame itself.
- Reverse-parsing arbitrary hand-written CSS into the visual model (preserved
  verbatim via `customCss`).
- Animations/timelines.
- An OBS-source-level independent timer toggle (intentionally removed; the
  director's `/timer/*` controls cover show/hide).

## Verification

- `tests/test_overlay.py`: border props compile to `border-*`; `borderWidth` is
  px-gated; `#clock` appears in `extract_slots(hud.html)`; `SAMPLE["hud"]`
  carries `clock`; color-normalizer maps `rgb()`→hex; full-snapshot layout
  compiles every slot.
- `tests/test_hud.py`: the merged page serves the clock markup + both poll
  targets.
- `tests/test_timer.py`: `/timer/data` + control endpoints still work; the
  `/timer` page route is gone.
- `tests/test_racecast.py` / `tests/test_ui_server.py`: `OBS_PAGE_PATHS` no
  longer lists `/timer*`; overlay routes operate on the single `hud` page.
- `python3 tools/run-tests.py` + `python3 tools/lint.py` + `python3
  tools/build.py` (verify step) all green.
- **Live check** in the running Control Center: Preview/Apply shows the clock at
  correct on-air scale/position inside the HUD, and a styled POV box frames the
  PiP. Confirm exact `#clock` pixels and the `HUD Overlay`-above-`Feed POV`
  ordering here, not by assertion.
