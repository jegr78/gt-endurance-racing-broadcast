# IRO Endurance Broadcast — Setup Package (for new producers / colleagues)

This package sets up a complete producer station: OBS scenes + HUD,
Companion button board, director panel and the Streamlink feed scripts.
Follow the steps **in this order**.

> Background on every tool is in **`IRO_Broadcast_Setup_Guide.md`**
> (Parts A–F + runbook). This README is the short checklist for the package.

---

## System Requirements

Run `python3 scripts/preflight.py` on the producer machine before every event —
it checks all of the below plus your tool chain, ports, and YouTube cookies.

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| CPU       | 6-core modern (Intel 12th-gen i5 / AMD Ryzen 5) | 8-core+ (i7 / Ryzen 7) |
| RAM       | 16 GB | 32 GB |
| GPU       | hardware encoder (NVIDIA NVENC / Apple Silicon / Intel QSV) | dedicated NVIDIA GPU w/ NVENC |
| Disk      | SSD, ≥ 5 GB free | SSD |
| OS        | Windows 10/11 64-bit or macOS 13+ | — |
| Network   | wired; stable upload headroom for the YouTube push + up to 3 feed pulls | wired gigabit |

**Before each event:** reboot the machine (clears swap and frees RAM), then run
the pre-flight check and resolve any FAIL/WARN before going live. The lower-third
HUD is now a **single** relay-served Browser Source (`http://127.0.0.1:8088/hud`)
instead of ~13 Google-Sheets-editor sources, which removes the biggest RAM/CPU
draw — but the relay must be running for the HUD to show. Live HUD values are
edited in the sheet's **Overlay** tab; team→manufacturer logos come from a
**`Brand Name`** text column in the **Configuration** tab, resolved against bundled
assets in `src/assets/flags/` and `src/assets/brands/`.

---

## 0. Extract the package to a permanent location
Put the extracted folder where it will **stay** (e.g. `~/IRO_Broadcast` or
`C:\IRO_Broadcast`). **Do not move it after the OBS import** — OBS stores
absolute image paths. (Moved it? Just redo step 2 + the OBS import.)

## 1. Install the tools (once)
- **OBS Studio 30+** · **Streamlink + yt-dlp + FFmpeg** · **deno** · **Bitfocus Companion** ·
  **Tailscale** · **Discord**
- Per-OS install commands: see guide **Part A–D**.
  - macOS short: `brew install streamlink yt-dlp ffmpeg deno`, OBS/Companion/Tailscale/Discord as apps.
- **`deno`** is the JS runtime yt-dlp uses to solve YouTube's anti-bot JS challenges — **required for the relay** (otherwise pulls fail with "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot"). Windows: `winget install DenoLand.Deno` (or see deno.land).

## 2. Rewrite the image paths to this folder
This points the OBS image sources at the broadcast graphics in this folder so they
show up right after the OBS import, and injects your Google-Sheet ID into the HUD
browser source. (Fetch the graphics first — see step **4e**: `python3 relay/get-graphics.py`.)
- **Set your Sheet ID first:** `cp .env.example .env`, then put the long ID from your
  HUD sheet URL (`.../spreadsheets/d/<THIS>/edit`) into `IRO_SHEET_ID`.
  (Or pass it inline: `python3 setup-assets.py --sheet-id <ID>`.)
- Open a terminal in this folder → `python3 setup-assets.py`
- Result: **`obs/IRO_Endurance.import.json`** (import this file — not the `.template.` one).

## 3. Set up OBS
1. **Import the scene collection:** OBS → `Scene Collection` → `Import` → `obs/IRO_Endurance.import.json` → then switch to `IRO Endurance`.
2. **Enable WebSocket:** `Tools` → `WebSocket Server Settings` → enable, **port 4455**, **authentication on**, **password = your team password** (the same one used in Companion — see step 5).
3. **Images there?** Overlay/Standings/… should be visible. If not: step 2 didn't run — run it again and re-import.
4. **Discord audio:**
   - The source **`Discord Audio Capture`** comes with the collection (macOS: `sck_audio_capture`, app = Discord).
   - **macOS:** grant OBS **screen & system audio recording** permission once (System Settings → Privacy). **Keep Discord in WINDOWED mode, NOT fullscreen** — otherwise it is not captured.
   - **Windows:** re-create the source as **Application Audio Capture** → pick Discord.
5. **Stream key** of the IRO YouTube channel in OBS (only at event time).

## 4. Streamlink feeds — static mode (per event)
- Put the streamers' channel IDs into the `FEEDS` list in `scripts/start-streams.py`: `(CHANNEL_ID, PORT)` (Feed A→53001, Feed B→53002, …).
- Ports must match the OBS media sources `Feed A`/`Feed B` (`http://127.0.0.1:<port>`).
- Start: `python3 scripts/start-streams.py`. Stop: `python3 scripts/stop-streams.py`.
- *Note:* this static mode is only for **public** channels / fixed feeds. For the typical endurance flow (one commentator per stint, unlisted) → **relay mode 4b**.

## 4b. Relay mode (recommended for endurance)
Two fixed feeds (A/B) "walk" along a **stint schedule** — Feed A serves stints 1,3,5…, Feed B 2,4,6…. At each handover the off-air feed advances to the next commentator. OBS stays unchanged (53001/53002).

*How it pulls (important):* the relay uses **yt-dlp to resolve** each live HLS URL (this is what passes YouTube's bot-check, via cookies + deno JS-challenge solving) and **streamlink to serve** that direct URL to OBS. So `cookies.txt` (step 3 below) + `deno` (step 1) are both required for reliable pulls. Streamlink alone — even with cookies — is blocked by the bot-check.

1. **Schedule = Google Sheet tab `Schedule`** (editable remotely by anyone). One column = entries in stint order; other columns (stint number / name) are ignored.
   - **Unlisted streams → watch URL** `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEOID` (the channel `/live` URL only works for PUBLIC streams!). The streamer/director enters their watch URL shortly before their stint.
   - Default sheet = the shared HUD sheet. Other sheet/tab: `--sheet-id …` / `--sheet-tab …`.
2. **Start:** `python3 relay/iro-feeds.py`  (replaces `start-streams`). **Stop:** Ctrl+C.
3. **Cookie hardening (important for the event)** against YouTube's "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot". Easiest — auto-export from your **logged-in** browser via yt-dlp:
   - One-off: `python3 relay/get-cookies.py chrome`  (or `firefox`/`safari`/`edge`/`brave`) → writes `relay/cookies.txt`.
   - Or let the relay do it on start: `python3 relay/iro-feeds.py --cookies-from-browser chrome`.
   - You must be **logged into YouTube** in that browser. macOS **Chrome/Edge**: approve the Keychain prompt; **Safari**: grant your terminal **Full Disk Access**. (Firefox needs neither.)
   - Manual alternative: drop any Netscape `cookies.txt` next to `relay/iro-feeds.py`.
   - It is auto-detected and passed to Streamlink (`--http-cookies-file`). `/status` shows `"cookies": true`. Re-run before each event (cookies rotate).
4. **Companion control** (connection **"Generic HTTP Requests"**, action *GET*):
   - `Feeds Next` → `http://127.0.0.1:8088/next`  *(press once per handover, right after cutting to the new feed)*
   - `Feeds Reload` → `http://127.0.0.1:8088/reload`  *(edited a cell in the sheet → reload the current feed immediately)*
   - `Feeds Status` → `http://127.0.0.1:8088/status`
   - Works for remote directors too (Companion makes the request locally on the producer station).

## 4c. Driver-POV PiP (optional goodie)
Show an ad-hoc driver-POV as a small picture-in-picture (bottom-right) over the active
feed in the **Stint** scene. Pulled by a third relay feed on port **53003** (capped at
720p), independent of the A/B ping-pong.

1. **Schedule it:** put the driver's live **watch URL** into the Google-Sheet tab
   **`POV`**, cell **A2** (A1 = header `url`). Empty cell = POV off.
2. **Pull it:** press **POV Reload** in Companion → the relay resolves + serves it on
   53003 (still hidden). `/status` shows the `pov` block (`state: serving`).
3. **Show it:** press **POV Toggle** → the PiP appears bottom-right in Stint.
4. **Audio:** muted by default; **MUTE POV** toggles the mute, **POV UP / POV DOWN**
   adjust its volume (use briefly).
5. **Done:** **POV Toggle** to hide, then **POV Stop** (frees the pull / bandwidth).

Two rules: **Reload before Toggle (show)**, and **hide + POV Stop when done**. The PiP
lives only in the Stint scene, so switching to Splitscreen/Interview/Standby auto-hides
and auto-silences it — no combo changes needed.

## 4d. Intro/Outro clips
The `Intro` and `Outro` OBS scenes play a local clip (looping, with audio) —
typically used to open and close the broadcast. Download (or refresh) the clips before each event:

```
python3 relay/get-media.py      # -> relay/../media/intro.mp4, outro.mp4
```

The clip URLs live in the Google Sheet **Assets** tab as label cells
`Intro Video` / `Outro Video` (the URL goes in the cell immediately to the right
of the label). You can also override them per-machine via `IRO_INTRO_URL` /
`IRO_OUTRO_URL` in your `.env` (see `.env.example`).

The director triggers the scenes with the **`INTRO`** / **`OUTRO`** Companion
buttons (Page 1, top row). The clip loops until the director presses another scene
button to leave.

## 4e. Broadcast graphics
The still-graphics (Overlay, Standings, Schedule, Race/Quali Results, the three
**weather** overlays, Standby, …) are **local files** downloaded from the Google Sheet
**Assets** tab — they are not shipped in git. Download (or refresh) them on this machine
**before `setup-assets.py`** (step 2), and again before each event if the sheet graphics
changed:

```
python3 relay/get-graphics.py      # -> graphics/<Label>.png (one PNG per Assets row)
```

The Sheet label *is* the filename (e.g. `Standings.png`, `Schedule.png`,
`Race Weather 1.png`). In the package the graphics ship under **`graphics/`** so the
artifact is self-contained; you can refresh them on site at any time by re-running
`get-graphics.py`. `setup-assets.py` points the OBS image sources at this folder; if a
graphic is missing it prints a warning and OBS shows that source black until you fetch it.

---

## 5. Set up Companion (director button board)
1. Start Companion → launcher → **GUI Interface = All Interfaces (0.0.0.0)** (important for Tailscale access), admin port `8000` → **Launch GUI**.
2. In the admin: `Import/Export` → **Import** → `companion/iro-buttons.companionconfig`. This is a **full config** → confirm "**Replace** current configuration". ⚠️ This **replaces the entire Companion configuration** on this station (fine for a fresh/dedicated producer station; back up first on a Companion instance with other content!).
3. The **OBS connection** (`127.0.0.1:4455`) comes with it — **but without the password** (removed for security). → `Connections` → open the OBS entry → **enter your OBS WebSocket password (step 3.2)** → the connection turns green.
4. Buttons (two pages):
   - **Page 1 — show control:**
     - *row 0 — combos:* `SPLIT`, `STINT A`, `STINT B`, `INTERVIEW`, `STANDBY` (one-press scene+source presets)
     - *row 1 — scene switches + relay control:* `Stint Scene`, `Split Scene`, `Interview Scene`, `Standby Scene`, `Feeds Reload` (→ `/reload`), `Feeds Next` (→ `/next`, the handover), `Feeds Status` (→ `/status`)
     - *row 2 — feeds & POV:* `Feed A Toggle`, `Feed B Toggle`, `POV Toggle`, `Split Left`, `Split Right`, `POV Reload`, `POV Stop`
     - *row 3 — graphics:* `Standings`, `Schedule`, `Race Results`, `Quali Results`, `HUD Stint Toggle`, `HUD Split Toggle`
     - *right-edge column (col 7, rows 1–3) — weather:* `Race Wx 1`, `Race Wx 2`, `Quali Wx` (full-screen Stint overlays, independent toggles)
   - **Page 2 — audio:**
     - *row 1 — mute:* `MUTE A`, `MUTE B`, `MUTE POV`, `MUTE DISC`
     - *row 2 — volume A/B:* `A DOWN`/`A UP`, `B DOWN`/`B UP`
     - *row 3 — volume POV/Discord:* `POV DOWN`/`POV UP`, `DISC DOWN`/`DISC UP`
5. Test: open `http://localhost:8000/tablet`, press a button → OBS reacts.

## 6. Remote directors (Tailscale)
- Start/sign in to Tailscale; invite the director(s) into the tailnet (`login.tailscale.com/admin/users`).
- Director URL: **`http://<PRODUCER-TAILSCALE-IP>:8000/tablet`** (producer IP via the Tailscale menu / `tailscale ip -4`).
- Directors only need a browser — no OBS, no password.

## 7. Director panel (optional backup console)
Companion (steps 5–6) is the primary control surface and is strictly more capable
(combo buttons, feedback colors, relay `HANDOVER`/`RELOAD`). The director panel is a
**backup** that talks to OBS directly — use it only if Companion is unavailable.

Two ways to open it:
- **Served by the relay (recommended):** the relay (step 4b) serves it at
  **`http://<producer-ip>:8088/panel`**. For remote directors start the relay with
  `--bind 0.0.0.0` (otherwise it is local-only). `--no-panel` disables it.
- **As a file:** open `director-panel.html` directly (via `file://` or `http://`, **not** `https://`).

Either way it then connects **straight to OBS** — so the director must enter the OBS IP
(`127.0.0.1` locally / producer Tailscale IP) + port `4455` + **OBS WebSocket password**.
(That password requirement is exactly why Companion is preferred for directors.)

---

## Important notes / pitfalls
- **Do not move the folder after the OBS import** (absolute image paths). Moved it → redo step 2 + import.
- **OBS WebSocket password:** NOT included in the Companion export — everyone enters it once after import (`Connections` → OBS). Set the same password in OBS (step 3.2).
- **HUD & graphics** pull live data from the **shared Google Sheet** and **stagetimer.io** — these are shared production resources (changes affect everyone). The sheet must stay shared.
- **Discord** must run in **windowed mode** (macOS audio capture).
- Before every event update the tools: `brew upgrade streamlink yt-dlp` (macOS) / `pip install -U streamlink yt-dlp` (Windows).
